# odin-weather-app
  
This project will be a weather app which fetches data from a free weather API after taking in a location search term and displays a small weather report for that location.  
  
The purpose of this project is to put into practice recently learned topics. I aim to display a clear understanding of these things:  
- Fetching data from an API  
- Asychronous JavaScript  
- Promises  
- async/await  
  
Of course this will also act as further practice for the rest of the things I've previously learned.
